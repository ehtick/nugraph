## [Unreleased][Unreleased]

* Fixed graph generation for packages on authenticated NuGet feeds.
* Fixed a bug where `nugraph` could fail with `InvalidProjectFileException` if run from a directory containing a `Directory.Build.props` file.
* Improved target framework detection for metapackages.
* Improved error message when the specified framework (with the `-f|--framework` option) is not supported.
* Use `@` instead of `/` for separating package name and version.

## [0.5.0][0.5.0] - 2025-06-27

* Links to nuget.org are now added only for packages which are actually available on the NuGet Gallery. Previously, a non-working link to nuget.org would be added for packages coming from private NuGet feeds.
* Packages which are unavailable on the NuGet Gallery are now rendered in beige (moccasin), unless the `--no-links` options is specified.
